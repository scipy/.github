This repository contains default "community health" files for the SciPy
project.  They will be used by GitHub for all repos, unless there's a file
with the same name (e.g. `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) in `reponame/.github/`.

See https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization
for more details.
